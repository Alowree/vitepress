## colorscheme

From within Vim editor, type following command to reset the color scheme from `default` to others.

`:colorscheme <colorname>`

Setting color themes did not go well at the very beginning, especially when trying to set a theme in light mode, because the changes only apply to areas with text content, but not to the entire background of the editor.

~~That~~ makes me to rethink installing oh-my-posh for PowerShell.

Following this tutorial here: [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows)

Yet again, the light themes appear to be incompatible with PowerShell. When implementing any themes with light background, the screen area where does not contain any text content remains dark or black, instead of maintaining a consistent light background.

Vim themes proved to be problematic when PowerShell is in light color mode:

-   `blue`
-   `delek`
-   test
-   test

## colorscheme through `vim-plug`

Install the following two themes by adding codes into `$VIM\vimrc`.

```vim

call plug#begin()

  Plug 'w0ng/vim-hybrid'
  Plug 'NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme'

call plug#end()

```

## colorscheme through `$VIMRUNTIME\colors`

Install `molokai` by cloning a `molokai.vim` file directly into folder `$VIMRUNTIME\colors`.

## Final resolution

The original background conflict from the terminal appears to be resolved after adding following configuration into the `vimrc` file:

```vim
set t_Co=256
```
