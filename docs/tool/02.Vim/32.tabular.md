Aligning Text with Tabular

Sometimes, it's useful to line up text. Tabular is a Vim script for text
filtering and alignment.

Once this plugin has been installed, within Vim run `:h Tabu` to view the help file.

## Aligning assignments

Before:

```js
one = 1;
two = 2;
three = 3;
four = 4;
```

Running `:Tabularize /=` produces:

```js
one   = 1;
two   = 2;
three = 3;
four  = 4;
```

## Colon assignments

Before:

```js
var video = {
    metadata: {
        title: "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src: "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc: "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc: "/media/alignment.png"
        duration: 320,
    }
}
```

First, instead of requiring a range, Tabular tries to figure out what you want to happen. Since it knows that you want to act on lines matching a colon, it will look upwards and downwards for lines around the current line that match a colon, and consider all contiguous lines matching the pattern to be the range to be acted upon.

Select the inner block by positioning your cursor inside it and running `vi}` (enable Visual mode, and select inner Brace). Then you could run `:Tabu /:` which would produce this result:

```js
ar video = {
    metadata: {
        title     : "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src   : "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc    : "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc : "/media/alignment.png"
        duration  : 320,
    }
}
```

If you donâ€™t like stacking the colons in a column, you could use the `\zs` atom to exclude the `:` character from the search match. Running `:Tabu /:\zs` produces this result:

```js
var video = {
    metadata: {
        title:      "Aligning assignments"
        h264Src:    "/media/alignment.mov",
        oggSrc:     "/media/alignment.ogv"
        posterSrc:  "/media/alignment.png"
        duration:   320,
    }
}
```
