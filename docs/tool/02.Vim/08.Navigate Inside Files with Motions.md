## 47. Keep Your Fingers on the Home Row

Vim is optimized for the touch typist. Learn to move around without removing your hands from the home row, and you'll be able to operate Vim quicker.

## 48. Distinguish Between Real Lines and Display Lines

Avoid frustration by learning the difference between real lines and disply lines. Vim lets us operate on both.

- The `j` and `k` commands move down and up by real lines
- The `gj` and `gk` commands move down and up by display lines

<!--NOTE:-->the `gj` and `gk` commands have been remapped to move to upper and lower headers in Markdown files.

## 49. Move Word-Wise

Vim has two speeds for moving backward and forward word-wise. Both allow for a more rapid traversal than moving by one column at a time.

| Command | Move Cursoe                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `w`     | Forward to start of next word              |
| `b`     | Backward to start of current/previous word |
| `e`     | Forward to end of current/next word        |
| `ge`    | Backward to end of previous word           |
