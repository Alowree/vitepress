Mappings in Vim are definitely a game changer. You can't beat it.

Just did several mappings that are most frequently used. Super love these shortcuts!

```vim
nnoremap <space>b :buffers<cr>:b<space>
nnoremap <space>e :b#<cr>
nnoremap <space>w :w<cr>
nnoremap <space>q :qa<cr>
nnoremap <space>re :e<space>$VIM\vimrc<cr>
```
