Now after some time of using init.vim as the configuration file, I decided to migrate from init.vim to init.lua file. This pretty much a follow through the setup of kickstart.nvim project. 

All configurations are in just one init.lua file.

## Features

- Lightweight, because not much plugins instaslled

## Known issues

This section is not so much about known issue, but rather about some wishful features that to be learned and implemented.
