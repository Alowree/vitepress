It isn’t a scripting language, nor is it a programming language, so the way we teach PowerShell needed to change as well. PowerShell is actually a command-line shell where you run command-line utilities. Like all good shells, it has scripting capabilities, but you don’t have to use them, and you certainly don’t have to start with them.

`$PSVersionTable`

Before you go any further, take a few minutes to customize PowerShell. If you’re using the text-based console host, we strongly recommend that you change the default console font to the Lucida fixed-width font.

1. How to reset the font in PowerShell?

Under path: `C:\Users\Alowr\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminalPreview_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json`

2. What font are you currently using for your PowerShell? `"MesloLGM Nerd Font"`

```json
        "defaults":
        {
            "colorScheme": "Breeze",
            "font":
            {
                "face": "MesloLGM Nerd Font",
                "size": 12
            }
        },
```
