With its compact size and textured finish, Sound Rise DAB is a true space-saver, ideal for bedrooms, offices and hotels
- FOR AN ENHANCED LISTENING EXPERIENCE: Sound Rise DAB features a precisely tuned high performance bass diaphragm that delivers powerful and smooth low frequencies. A custom-designed monophonic driver delivers balanced audio with vocal clarity, while a passive radiator enhances bass response and is optimised for distortion-free volume. 6 preset EQ available for different timbers
- VERSATILE FUNCTIONALITY & FAST CHARGING: More than just a desktop Bluetooth speaker, Sound Rise DAB also features 2 fast USB charging ports that support up to 2 connected devices simultaneouslyâ€”1 USB Type-C port (PD fast charging) and 1 USB Type-A port (18W QC3.0). An optional Soundfreaq wireless charger can be seamlessly integrated into the main unit
- EASY SETUP & INTUITIVE INTERFACE: The Sound Rise DAB interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Users can effortlessly set 2 separate alarms, adjust volume, and tune the DAB+ radio or FM radio using a pair of sleek dials. This intuitive design ensures that even first-time users can set up and operate the DAB+ radio with ease, making it an ideal choice for hotel guests
- STAY RELAXED & PEACE OF MIND: Sound Rise DAB is also a nature sound machine. This allows users to enjoy soothing nature sounds such as bird chirping, forest sounds, ocean waves, rain dripping, city sounds and temple bells.

- PROGRESSIVE WAKE-UP VOLUME: This alarm clock is perfect for anyone who hates being woken up abruptly.
