## Overview

This information pertains to FBA Sellers only.

Welcome to the Fulfillment Reports page. All fulfillment reports can be found in the left-hand column. Reports are split up into Inventory, Sales, Payments, Customer Concessions, and Removals. Read below for informative tips and help on getting the most out of your reports.

You can download reports as comma-separated values (.csv) or in text (.txt) format. Using .csv format will let you open reports in a spreadsheet. However, the leading zeros from MSKUs, ASINs, and FNSKUs will be dropped. If you require the leading zeros, you can download the file in .txt format. For more information on how to import a .txt file, review the help content for the spreadsheet application that you use.
