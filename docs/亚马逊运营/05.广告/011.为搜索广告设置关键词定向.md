## 背景

广告活动开展了一个多月，发现各种广告的实际表现跟学习的理论和自己的预期有很大的不同。关于手动广告的关键词定向，有以下几个相对重要的发现：

1. 关键词广告带来的成交占比远远低于预期，我们希望提升关键词定向的占比
2. 行业大词的广告效率表现 ACOS=40% 左右，我们希望采取措施控制 ACOS 至 20%，但目前仍在 30% 左右徘徊
3. （3 个）大词的关键词广告，有曝光、有流量、有订单，但广告效率需要提升
4. （7 个）长尾词的关键词广告，广告效率精准高效，但无曝光、无流量
5. 两组关键词广告的匹配类型全部设定为 Phrase

### Step 1: Find keywords to target

To start a keyword strategy for your Amazon sponsored ads campaigns, the first step is finding relevant ones for your keyword list. Try these four strategies:

- Leverage your Sponsored Products automatic campaigns. Use your Search Term Report to learn which keywords perform best in your automatic campaigns.
- Be specific. Use keyword combinations that clearly define your products’ characteristics, materials, or benefits.
- Use your brand’s name. Include your brand’s name to help increase impressions on branded searches, or even introduce more of your catalog to shoppers browsing for products from your brand by name.
- Go organic. Use keywords that you’ve added to your product detail page since they’ll have relevance.

With these strategies, you can begin adding keywords to your campaigns.

### Step 2. Add your keywords

How specific you get with the keywords you include in your manual keyword targeting matters. If you’re launching a new product and want to help drive awareness, you might want to focus on more generic keywords. But if you’re looking to introduce products to shoppers who are already familiar with your brand, you might want to focus on branded keywords, which include your own brand’s name. Here are some types of keywords to consider for your campaigns:

- **Generic keywords:** less specific keywords that are often shorter or representative of broader categories (e.g., chair or dining chair)
- **Longtail keywords:** more specific keywords (usually at least a few words long) that generally have lower search volume but higher relevance (e.g., white wood dining chair)
- **Branded keywords:** keywords that include your brand’s name (e.g., Modernata dining chair set)
- **Seasonal keywords:** keywords that incorporate seasonal terms for particular moments or peak periods during the year (e.g., Valentine’s Day table decor)

It’s important to group your keywords according to your advertising objectives. That way, you can better target keywords, bid, measure, and budget.

Not only does the specificity of your keywords matter, so does the keyword match type. This determines how closely the keywords you bid on match to customer shopping queries. You’ve got three options:

- **Broad match:** These least restrictive broad match keywords yield the highest potential traffic exposure. They’re best for driving awareness and for gaining insights into how shoppers are discovering your products. With broad match, your ad can display when shoppers browse using any of the words, in any order. They can be good for your generic keywords, and you can expect to bid higher for these.
- **Phrase match:** Slightly more restrictive, phrase match keywords are good for your longtail keyword strategy—those more specific keywords—to help drive consideration and conversion.
- **Exact match:** The most restrictive and precise of all, exact match keywords are well suited for helping drive conversions. Add them after you’ve done research on the shopping queries that perform well for you. You might bid lower on these and see lower traffic, but they’re more likely to be highly relevant.

There’s no magic number to how many keywords to add to your keyword targeting, but we do recommend a minimum of 25 terms. Combine the specificity of keywords you use with the right match type for your goals, and you’re well on your way to a successful keyword targeting strategy.

### Step 3: Optimize your keyword strategy

Keyword targeting isn’t a “set it and forget it” kind of thing. Once you’ve had a campaign running for about two weeks, you should have enough insights to make informed optimization decisions for your keyword targeting.

You can improve and optimize your keyword strategy in three ways: by refining match types, adding new keywords, and adding negative keyword targets.

**To refine match types,** take a look in your campaign manager at which keywords and match types are providing strong results, like a high return on ad spend (ROAS) and a low advertising cost of sales (ACOS). If you’ve got a keyword with a specific match type that’s underdelivering for your specific goal, you can pause it.

**To add new keywords,** keep checking your Search Term Report to see how shoppers are browsing for your product, and add high performers that match your goals using exact match.

**To add negative keywords,** consider if there are any shopping queries you don’t wish your ads to show against. If you’re advertising a luxury product, shopping queries like “cheap” or “inexpensive” are likely not relevant for shoppers. You can add those, plus any from your Search Term Report that aren’t driving results. A negative keyword strategy can improve ad relevance. It can help also help you control your budget and ensure a refined keyword targeting strategy.
