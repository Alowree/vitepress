- [Top-of-search impression share (IS)](https://advertising.amazon.com/zh-cn/resources/whats-new/top-of-search-impression-share-metric): The percentage of top-of-search impressions the campaign received of all the top-of-search impressions it was eligible to receive. Eligibility is determined by various factors, including campaign status and target status. This metric is available for Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products campaigns. Top-of-search IS data is accessible for the last 90 days. For Sponsored Products, this metric gives the impression share for Top-of-search (first page).

现在，您可以使用搜索结果顶部展示量份额（搜索结果顶部 IS）指标更好地衡量广告活动在提高品牌认知度方面的成效。此指标的定义是广告活动获得的搜索结果顶部展示量占其符合条件的搜索结果顶部展示量总数的百分比。该指标适用于的品牌推广活动和商品推广活动，回溯期为 90 天。对于商品推广，该指标提供了搜索结果顶部（第一页）的展示量份额。

> 言外之意，刨去“搜索结果顶部 IS”之外的份额，SP 广告都是展示在“搜索其余部分”和产品页面。

通过搜索结果顶部展示量份额来了解您的广告活动在提高搜索结果顶部展示量方面的成效。为了帮助提高商品推广活动的搜索结果顶部展示量份额，请根据广告位调整竞价，以帮助提高搜索结果顶部的展示机会。

现有问题：

1. 露出的广告创意是什么？是所推广商品的 **第一张主图** 吗？
2. 点击率（0.07%）如此之低，说明消费者看到广告但并未点击。What strategy could you take in order to optimize your campaign in this situation? Use negative keywords targeting in your campaign.
3. 如何查看 店铺/产品 流量来源？

优化措施：

1. Instead of mixing 3 products into the same campaign/ad group, create at least 2 separate campaigns/ad groups, one for alarm clock radio, and the other for portable speaker. Ideally to create 3 individual ad groups for better matrics visibility of each ASIN.

2. Instead of 100% leaning over automatic targeting, gradually migrate to mannual targeting, where you could use select keywords that are proven effective from previous campaigns.

3. According to Placement report dated Jan 1 - Jan 21, 2024: First page Top of Search on Amazon > Rest of search on Amazon > Product pages on Amazon. To optimize our bidding strategy, we can set bid multipliers by placement type to increase your bids by a certain percentage (up to 900%) for placement at the top of search results or product pages. We should lower bidding for Product pages on Amazon.
