北美帐号的开通，卖家们大都是奔着美国市场去的，但是平台却给你来了个一键三连，大致相当于开美国账号自动附送了加拿大和巴西两个帐号。

## Canada

Hello from Amazon,

We are writing to let you know that the following detail pages have been removed from our catalog:

ASIN: B00JBRZ7U6, SKU: SFQ-08, Title: Soundfreaq Sound Rise Black (SFQ-08) Wireless Bluetooth Speaker + Alarm Clock with FM Radio and USB Charger

This product has been identified as Category I or terminal equipment on Amazon.ca that requires compliance information mandated by Canadian regulatory body, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED). To comply with ISED regulations, you must provide the following compliance information for each product you are listing: The ISED Certification Number (for Category I equipment) or ISED Registration Number (for terminal equipment); and The Hardware Version Identification Number (HVIN). For instructions on how to add compliance information for your listing, please see <https://sellercentral.amazon.ca/help/hub/reference/external/HXJGN6T5K8HGGWW>

Why is this happening?

We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.ca. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon's policies.

## IC ID

Soundfreaq Sound Rise II 已经获取关于加拿大的认证有两个，ISED 认证和 IC 符合认证。亚马逊加拿大要求的是 ISED 认证，需要在 Listing 后台 Safety & Compliance 分栏内填写相关资料。以下两项任选一项填写即可：

- The ISED Certification Number: 28018-SFQ16
- The Hardware Version Identification Number: SFQ-16

问题：

ISED 认证和 IC 符合认证，二者的测试和认证内容各有什么侧重？有何不同？

> Soundfreaq Sound Spot II 在 FCC ID 基础上再申请增加一个 IC ID，额外成本 2,500 美元。
