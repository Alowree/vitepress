### Amazon Global Logistics

[Amazon Global Logistics](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gssportal/index.html)

To be explored further...

Our existing HS code being used is 8518.21.00, which is duty free, but subject to another article 9903.88.15, which is subject to +7.5% additional duty. This is consistent with the feedback we received from another logistics company (WealthRich) when we shipped the Kimpton New York order in 2023 summer.

For us to be able to import duty free into the USA, a new HS code has been proposed for future shipments, 8527.92.00.00, which is duty free and without any surcharges.

> The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) sets out the tariff rates and statistical categories for all merchandise imported into the United States. The HTS is based on the international Harmonized System, which is the global system of nomenclature applied to most world trade in goods.

### Ship to AWD

[FBA Basics 1.10 – AWD Program](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/learn/courses?ref_=selleru_athena&courseId=db6ad535-5f52-4330-aed4-e79fd2cd4327&moduleId=df3d3c7f-7dfe-4890-83b6-a02d3c6115c3&modLanguage=English&contentType=DOCUMENT&category=TUTORIAL&ref=xx_SellerUniversity_xxxx_meldedSidebarSearch&mons_sel_mkid=amzn1.mp.o.ATVPDKIKX0DER&mons_sel_mcid=amzn1.merchant.o.A1ZU3V2ZXZ5QHR&mons_sel_persist=true)

Once we have received inventory at AWD, we will need to test run “3. Move SKUs to Amazon and non-Amazon destinations”, which is likely to support bulk orders from hotel customers. My understanding is that AWD can only handle full box orders, but not individual gift box orders. Let's find out whether this is true.
