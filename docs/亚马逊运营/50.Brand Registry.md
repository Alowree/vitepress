通常一个品牌卖家，下面会注册多个用户的操作帐号。已经拥有了 Seller Central 和 Advertising 操作权限的用户帐号，会自动拥有 Brand Registry 的登陆帐号，但没有同时拥有操作“品牌登记”的相关权限，必须通过 Brand Registry 的管理员帐号事先分配权限。

[Brand Registry protection roles](https://brandregistry.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GCF9UE9VGKGA2W5F)

There are three protection roles available for Brand Registry accounts that are connected with your brand:

- Administrator: The individual who has full permission to assign roles to user accounts.
- Rights Owner: The trademark owner, or their employee, who has access to Report a violation and brand protection benefits.
- Registered Agent: A third party who is authorized by the Rights Owner to use Report a violation and brand protection benefits.

对于自有品牌店铺的直接员工，例如店铺运营，可以向公司管理层申请 Rights Owner 的权限。
