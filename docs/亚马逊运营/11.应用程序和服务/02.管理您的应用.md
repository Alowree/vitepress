ACTION REQUIRED - Your software application authorization will expire in 30 days

Dear xxx Store

Action is required by you to renew your authorization to enable software applications from Never Settle to access your Amazon selling account on your behalf using Amazon Marketplace Web Service. This might impact your Amazon integration, including your Amazon Pay integration if you have one.

For your security, we periodically contact you to confirm that only software application providers with whom you are actively working are allowed to access your Amazon selling account data on your behalf.

The provider listed below has access to your account. That access will expire on 2024-04-10.

Please either renew or revoke this access to your account on the [Manage Your Apps](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/apps/manage/ref=xx_masman_dnav_xx) page in Seller Central. You can access this page at any time by signing into Seller Central and selecting [Manage Your Apps](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/apps/manage/ref=xx_masman_dnav_xx) in the Apps & Services menu. If you do not renew the developer’s access before the expiration date then that access will be suspended and their software will no longer access your data. You can re-authorize suspended access from Manage Your Apps page.

Developer ID:446453545547
Developer nickname: Never Settle
Access expiration date: 2024-04-10

Thanks,

Amazon Marketplace Web Service

基于 WordPress + WooCommerce 搭建的独立站，面向美国的零售客户。当客户在线完成下单和付款完成之后，我们希望生成的订单被自动推送至亚马逊店铺，在后台自动生成一个 MCF 订单，并通过亚马逊物流履行订单、完成发货。

要完成上述工作流程的部署，卖家需要做两件事情：一是在 WordPress 独立站的后台，购买和安装一个名为 Amazon Fulfillment (MCF) for WooCommerce 的插件，费用是 74 美元/年；二是在亚马逊 Seller Central 台后，对相应插件通过 API 访问 Amazon MWS 进行授权，期限通常是 1 年。
