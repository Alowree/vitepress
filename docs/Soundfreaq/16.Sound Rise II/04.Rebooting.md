Dec 2nd Original rebooting steps:

1. Press POWER button to turn on the unit (from Standby to ON)
2. Press SOURCE button to switch the channel to Bluetooth mode (with the Bluetooth icon on the upper left corner starts to blink)
3. Press and Hold SETUP button for 3 second to enter date & time setting (with Year 2022 starts to blink)
4. Press and Hold PRESET button (right next to the VOLUME knob) for 5 seconds to reset the unit back to its factory default settings. This process just takes a few seconds to complete, and once it is done, the screen will enter the initial setup interface, which is actually the very same interface for setting a brand-new unit out of the box.
5. Unplug the power jack for about 5 seconds (so as to cut off power and erase previous memorized setting) and plug it in again, we should still have the same interface from Step#4.
6. Press and Hold SETUP button for 3 second to enter date & time setting (with Year 2022 starts to blink), and so on…just complete the rest of the setting as according to the user manual.
