## User criticism

First message:

> So this morning I woke up again to your annoying default alarm rather than using the Bluetooth that was all set up. This happens way too often since I got the device where your Sound Rise II doesn’t play my Bluetooth that is all set up. And it makes for a bad morning.
>
> I don’t understand why you can just add an option to read from a USB folder and play songs from that. You have the ports. Keep it simpler that way I don’t have to worry about setting up my phone every night.
>
> And also speaking of problems when you shut off the alarm it’s stupid that you then have to re-lower your brightness setting if you adjusted it.
>
> With that being said I will be finding an alternative to your product even though the form factor is good as well as the sound quality, physical buttons, and screen brightness adjustability with it going to max brightness when the alarm is on.

Second message:

> I always have the screen at the lowest brightness or second lowest during the night. The alarm goes off and plays music on the good days or sounds on the bad day. It can be 15-30 minutes before I hit the button to turn it off. But the screen stays on. I only hit the button once but it shuts off the music right away.

## PRD Definition

> The behavior is the same for both the Home version and the Hotel version of the Sound Rise II.

The `DIMMER` button controls the brightness of the LCD backlight. There are six levels of brightness control for the LED backlight.

| Level | Brightness                |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 5     | 100% (Brightness Maximum) |
| 4     | 75%                       |
| 3     | 50%                       |
| 2     | 25%                       |
| 1     | 5%                        |
| 0     | 0 (Backlight turned off)  |

> The supplier has been advised to refer to that of SFQ-08 for the actual brightness of each level for Sound Rise II development.

**UI Operation**

1. Press the `DIMMER` button to cycle through the dimmer levels (`5` → `4` → `3` → `2` → `1` → `0` → `5` → `4`...)
2. Special Display Brightness Control (when brightness is set at low levels, namely `Level 0` or `Level 1`)

   **Scenario 1: (User Interaction)**
   When the unit is in Standby Mode, if the dimmer is set to `Level 0` or `Level 1`, and there is any user interaction such as pressing any key, touching the `SNOOZE` button, or turning the rotary knobs, the LCD backlight will temporarily turn on and stay on at `Level 4` for 8 seconds.

   **Scenario 2: (During Alarm Going Off)**
   When the unit is in Standby Mode and the alarm goes off and sounds, if the dimmer is set to `Level 0` or `Level 1`, the LCD backlight will temporarily turn on and remain on at `Level 4` until further user interaction (i.e. to press `SNOOZE` or turn alarm off).

## Recommended ECN

Modify the brightness behavior as according the original PRD definition, as follows, highlighted in ==YELLOW==:

| Level | Brightness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Quick Turn Around

I will suggest the customer to try setting on brightness `level 2`, as it will not return to max brightness.

This brightness behavior — the display automatically lights up to `level 4` when at `level 0` and `level 1` and after the alarm being manually turned off — is a well thought-out design and considered an improvement on the original Sound Rise SFQ-08. However, for the very same feature, some troll it, and others appreciate it.

## Customer praise

> I just wanted to take a moment to let you know that we are very pleased with our new Rise II, and we are enjoying the additional features it offers over the original Rise. We are loving the ability to turn the display off when ready for sleep, and having it automatically illuminate when the alarm is activated, as my wife is very sensitive to light while sleeping. That was great thinking, on someone's part. —Duane F.
