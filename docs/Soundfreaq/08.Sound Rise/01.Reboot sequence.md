We have a reset sequence for the Sound Rise SFQ-08, and here are the steps to reset:

1. Press SNOOZE to enter standby mode (off mode where only the clock is displayed, no music is played).
2. Press and hold TONE (on the bottom of the back panel), then press and hold SET (on the top panel) for about 3 seconds to restart the unit.

After restarting, the Sound Rise will lose all settings such as alarm and time.
