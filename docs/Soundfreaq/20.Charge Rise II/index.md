## Snooze

Please explain what the SNOOZE function is, typically seen in an alarm clock.

The snooze button on an alarm clock is a built-in feature that allows users to delay the sounding of the alarm for a set amount of time, typically between 5 and 15 minutes. When the alarm goes off, pressing the snooze button activates a temporary silence, halting the alarm sound. Instead of immediately turning off the alarm, it sets it on hold, giving you a brief window of extra sleep before it sounds again. So, it‚Äôs like a little gift of extra rest in the morning! üò¥üï∞Ô∏è
